# Week 3 Assignment - Discount Calculator

## Description

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The discount is only applied if it is **20% or higher**; otherwise, the original price remains unchanged.

## Functionality

  - Checks if the discount percentage is **20% or higher**.
  - If the discount is **valid**, it calculates the final price.
  - Otherwise, it returns the **original price**.
- The program **prompts the user** to enter:
  - The **original price** of an item.
  - The **discount percentage**.
- It then **displays the final price**, applying the discount if applicable.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the original price of the item.
3. Enter the discount percentage.
4. The program will display the final price.
